## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- A shortcuts section in the settings dock
	- Hover over the input for each shortcut and press the desired key or mouse button (with or without modifier keys).
	- Toggle desired modifier keys separately if necessary.
	- Similar behavior to Godot's own shortcut system (allows Mouse Buttons as well).
	- Available Shortcuts to be set:
		- **Set 3D Cursor Location** (default: `Shift + Right Mouse Button`)
		- **Create a new 3D Cursor** (default: `Shift + Ctrl + Right Mouse Button`)
		- **Recover 3D Cursor** (default: `Shift + Alt + Right Mouse Button`)
		- **Show Pie Menu** (default: `Shift + S`; useful to rebind if you're using Freeflight)
	- Press the **Apply**-Button to apply the new shortcuts.
	- Press the **Reset**-Button to revert all shortcuts to their default state.
	- Press the **Hide Shortcuts** button to collapse the shotcuts section (Won't disable set shortcuts)
- Shortcuts are project persistent and will be saved in a hidden config file at `res://addons/godot_3d_cursor/.config/shortcuts.cfg` (Please don't touch)

## [2.2.1] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed
- After invoking the **Create Path3D From Cursors** action, the title of the node selector dialog would not reset back to the default "Select a Node" on other actions.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- Semantic coloring for ID labels of 3D Cursor instances.
	- Default color for inactive cursors is yellow.
	- Default color for the active cursor is orange.
	- Default color for selected cursors (including the active one) is light blue.
	- Colors can be adjusted via the settings dock under **General Settings** (not session persistent).
- **Auto Recover Cursor** option added to the settings dock (equivalent to `Shift + Alt + Right Click`).
	- When placing a 3D Cursor with `Shift + Right Click` while no active cursor is selected:
		- **Enabled**: The most recently created cursor in the current scene is recovered as the active cursor and moved to the target location. If no cursor exists, a new one is created at the target location.
		- **Disabled**: A new 3D Cursor is created and placed at the target location.

### Fixed
- After reloading a project containing one or more 3D Cursor instances in the active scene, creating a new cursor could cause the plugin to not recognize existing cursors.

### Changed
- Set Gizmo extents of 3D Cursors to `0`.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- Running the game with at least one 3D cursor in the scene will throw an `Invalid call`-error (Issue #8).

## [2.1.1] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- The coordinate preview is not displayed correctly while dragging a valid node onto the *Move Active 3D Cursor to ...* button.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- **Compatibility with `Path3D`**
	- When a `Path3D` node is selected in the scene tree, adding a new point to its curve will place the point at the position of the active 3D Cursor. This requires exactly one selected node and an active 3D Cursor.
	- When a single `Path3D` node is selected, additional points can be added directly to its curve by placing extra cursors using `Shift + Ctrl + Right Click`. New points are always appended to the end of the curve.

- **Create Path3D From Cursors**
	- Added a *Create Path3D From Cursors* button to the settings dock.
	- Added a *Create Path3D From Cursors* action to the command palette.
	- Clicking the button opens a node selector to choose a parent node.
	- A new `Path3D` node is created as a child of the selected node. Its curve is built from all 3D Cursor positions in the active scene, ordered alphabetically.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed

- Nil object access when toggling checkboxes in the settings dock without an active cursor.

### Changed

- Improved the plugin info dialog (accessible through the settings dock)
	- Added contribution link for the Godot Engine
	- Extract displayed plugin version from the `plugin.cfg`

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added

#### Settings Dock

##### 3D Cursor Settings
- All previously existing settings for 3D Cursors (`Cursor3D`).
- New *Show Number Label* checkbox to toggle the numeric label on *3D Cursor* instances.
- Settings persist and are restored when a *3D Cursor* is selected as active.

##### Active Cursor
- *Raycast Mode* dropdown:
	- Allows selecting how the *3D Cursor* determines its position.
	- *Physicsless* (introduced in 1.4.0) for Godot 4.5+. Fully compatible with `Terrain3D` by *TokisanGames*.
	- *Physics* for Godot 4.2+ (legacy; maintenance and fixes only).
- *Active Cursor* field:
	- Displays the name of the active *3D Cursor* in the current scene.
	- No active cursor selected:
		- `Left Click` opens a node selector (restricted to `Cursor3D` nodes).
		- Drag-and-drop *3D Cursor* (`Cursor3D`) instances to assign them as active.
	- Active cursor selected:
		- `Left Click` selects the active *3D Cursor* in the node tree and editor.
		- `Double Left Click` selects the cursor and focuses the editor camera on it.
		- `Ctrl + Left Click` selects the cursor, focuses the camera, and zooms to a fixed distance.
		- `Alt + Left Click` opens the node selector again.
- *Deselect* button:
	- Deselects the active cursor in both the node tree and editor.
- *Clear* button:
	- Clears the *Active Cursor* field.
	- Unsets the active *3D Cursor* internally.
	- Disables the *Pie Menu*.
	- Allows reassignment of a *3D Cursor* (`Cursor3D`).

##### Extensions
- *Use Terrain3D* checkbox:
	- Toggles visibility of `Terrain3D`-specific group controls.
- *Add “Terrain3D” Group to Instances* button:
	- Adds the required group to all `Terrain3D` instances in the active scene (required for *Physicsless* raycast mode).
- *Remove “Terrain3D” Group from Instances* button:
	- Removes the group from all `Terrain3D` instances in the active scene.

##### Actions
- All previously available *3D Cursor* actions as buttons.
- *Remove All 3D Cursors From Scene* button.
- *Move Active 3D Cursor To* button:
	- Clicking opens a node selector; selecting a node moves the active cursor to its position.
	- Supports drag-and-drop of nodes inheriting from `Node3D` (excluding the active cursor).
	- Supports drag-and-drop of inspector properties with the following types:
		- `PackedVector2Array`, `PackedVector3Array`, `PackedVector4Array`
			- Only the first element is used.
			- Default mapping: `x -> x`, `y -> y`, `0 -> z`
			- Hold `Shift` to use: `x -> x`, `0 -> y`, `y -> z`
		- `Transform2D`, `Transform3D`
		- `Vector2`, `Vector2i`
			- Default mapping: `x -> x`, `y -> y`, `0 -> z`
			- Hold `Shift` to use: `x -> x`, `0 -> y`, `y -> z`
		- `Vector3`, `Vector3i`
			- Mapping: `x -> x`, `y -> y`, `z -> z`
		- `Vector4`, `Vector4i`
			- Mapping: `x -> x`, `y -> y`, `z -> z` (`w` is discarded)
		- Specially structured `Dictionary`:
			- Must contain keys `x`, `y`, and `z` (case-insensitive),
			  each mapping to either a `float` or an `int`.

#### General
- Support for multiple *3D Cursors* per scene, with active cursor selection via the new *Settings Dock*.
- *3D Cursor* instances now display an additional numeric ID label above the existing label.
	- IDs are assigned sequentially per scene and reset when all cursors are removed.
- When multiple cursors exist, their ID is appended to the node name, respecting the
  `editor/naming/node_name_num_separator` project setting.
- Additional key combinations:
	- `Shift + Ctrl + Left Click` on a collider or mesh places a new cursor and sets it as active.
	- `Shift + Alt + Left Click` moves the most recently created cursor to the target location and sets it as active.
- `Cursor3D` instances now automatically remove themselves when the plugin is disabled
  and a scene containing them is opened.

### Changed

- **1.5.x:** Raised the minimum supported Godot version to 4.5+ (Godot 4.2.x, 4.3.x, 4.4.x is no longer supported on this track)
- Major refactor of the whole plugin.
- Reorganized scripts, assets, and scenes for improved maintainability.
- Replaced scene file paths with UIDs.
- Reworked the Godot version compatibility check.
- Moved settings previously stored on `Cursor3D` instances into the settings dock.
- Split the *Remove 3D Cursor from Scene* action into:
	- *Remove Active 3D Cursor from Scene*
	- *Remove All 3D Cursors From Scene*
